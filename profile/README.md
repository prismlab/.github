## Prism at IIT Madras ðŸŒˆâƒ¤ 

Prism lab at IIT Madras aims to build robust systems with programming language technology. We develop programming language abstractions and tools that empower developers to build secure, scalable and reliable software systems. The group is headed by [KC Sivaramakrishnan](https://kcsrk.info). The [publications page](https://kcsrk.info/publications.html) gives an idea of what the group _has_ been working on in the recent past. 

If you are interested in joining the group, see this [post]().
